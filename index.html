        Hi baby! Happy New Year! ðŸŽ‰ I've been thinking a lot as the year wraps
        up, and I wanted to share some of my feelings with you. This past year
        has its ups and downs, right?
        <br />
        We've had some awesome moments and, let's be real, a few arguments too.
        But here we are, ready to kick off a new year together.
        <br />
        I just want you to know that every disagreement we've had hasn't made me
        love you any less but it even made our relationship more stronger. we've
        had tough times, but we've also had some amazing ones.
        <br />
        Let's start fresh and make this year awesome for us. I love you for who
        you are, your flaws and imperfections. cheers to more laughs, fewer
        fights, and another year of loving each other sooo much!!!
        <br />
        iloveyousomuch baby!!! always remember that even in tough times you
        always got meeee hihi
        <br />
        <br />With love, Dharjay
